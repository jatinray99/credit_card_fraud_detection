# 📊 Credit Risk Assessment and Analytics

A comprehensive and interactive **Credit Risk Assessment Dashboard** built using **Streamlit**, powered by **XGBoost** and **tree-based classification models**, enriched with **SMOTE** for data balancing, and enhanced using **Explainable AI** techniques like **LIME** and **SHAP**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project aims to evaluate credit risk for financial institutions using machine learning and interactive visualization. It includes:

* A machine learning pipeline using **XGBoost** and **decision tree-based models**.
* Data preprocessing with **SMOTE** to handle class imbalance.
* A fully interactive **dashboard on Streamlit** for risk prediction and analytics.
* Integration of **Explainable AI** tools (LIME & SHAP) to enhance model interpretability and trust.

---

## 🧠 Features

### ✅ Machine Learning

* **XGBoost Classifier**: High-performance gradient boosting model.
* **Tree-based Models**: For comparative evaluation and performance check.
* **SMOTE**: Synthetic oversampling to address imbalanced data.

### 📊 Dashboard (Streamlit)

* Upload and analyze individual or batch client data.
* Visual representation of risk predictions.
* Model performance metrics (Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC, Precision, etc.).
* Interactive filters for data segmentation and visualization.

### 🧾 Explainable AI

* **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**: Visualizes feature importance and individual prediction impact.
* **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)**: Provides local interpretability for predictions.
